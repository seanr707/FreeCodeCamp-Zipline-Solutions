# FreeCodeCamp-Zipline-Solutions for [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com/)
My solutions for FreeCodeCamps Ziplines
All solutions are my intellectual property and are not to be used without my credit and/or to cheat the FreeCodeCamp cirricullum.
-----------------------------------------------  
Solutions are from various times, the Simon Zip being the most recent as of this edition (9/2/2015).

Each folder contains Javascript files titled revisionX.js, as I had not been using GitHub for revision control during my beginnings of the exercises.
  
JQuery is used for the earlier Zipline solutions, and AngularJS in the later, more recent solutions.
Angular solutions include their corresponding HTML files.

The Simon Says Zipline has a Flask Python server with it, but this was only used for testing purposes.
